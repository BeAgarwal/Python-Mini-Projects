# Python-Mini-Projects
## Mini Projects developed in Python.


#### **1. VIRTUAL ASSISTANT**

Virtual Assistant is developed in Python to open up several applications. In this project, I have given the name as Eric to my personal Virtual Assistant. Eric can tell us the time, date, can search anything on the web, can search video on youtube, can open Gmail and Amazon. Plus Eric can calculate several arithmetic problems. This project is developed on Raspberry Pi.

 **Following are the important libraries used in this project:**
 >1. speech_recognition
 >2. selenium
 >3. wikipedia

#### **2. DICE ROLLING**

Dice are used in many games of chance as a way of picking random numbers on which to bet, and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to move, results of a conflict, etc. The random library is used to generate the random number from the dice.

  **How to Run**
  >1. Remember! You have installed python(3+) in your PC.
  >2. Open *terminal* and go to the location where you have saved the code.
  >3. Run code as *python dice_rolling.py*.
  
#### **3. PASSWORD GENERATOR**

Mini Project (Program) which generates a random password for the user. The program will ask the user how long they want their password to be. The password will be a mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. The password should be a minimum of 6 characters long.

  **How to Run**
  >1. Remember! You have installed python(3+) in your PC.
  >2. Open *password_generator.py*.
  >3. Click on Run button in the menu button or Press F5 (fn+F5).
  
#### **4. ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAME**

A rock-paper-scissors game is a hand game usually played between two people. But here it will between the player and the computer. The computerâ€™s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will ask the user for their input.

  **How to Run**
  >1. Remember! You have installed python(3+) in your PC.
  >2. Open *terminal* and go to the location where you have saved the code.
  >3. Run code as *rock_paper_scissor.py*.
  

  
#### **5. TIC TAC TOE**

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

  **How to Run**
  >1. Remember! You have installed python(3+) in your PC.
  >2. Open *tic_tac_toe.py*.
  >3. Click on Run button in the menu button or Press F5 (fn+F5).
  
  #### **6. Snake Slithering Game**

Snake Slithering Game is developed by using the pygame library in python.
